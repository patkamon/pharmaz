# Pharmaz



***Pharmaz*** is a decentralized application deployed on Polygon Mumbai testnet.
The purpose of Pharmaz is to transform prescriptions into NFTs.
The problem statement Pharmaz choose is the number 3 solutions that can be deployed in a healthcare setting, for tracking and manage prescription for drugs or medicines.
Note: Pharmacy is a project for GDSC HackNMIMS for more info [click here](https://devfolio.co/projects/pharmaz-3f5a)
Note: [Pharmacy](https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmQ9scKkyknUZWYdPGkLQknA878paa8PizqZWTW7G2BeSb) was already deployed using spheron and filecoin technology.

***Process***
By using this doctor will no longer need to give you a prescription paper that is difficult to manage or take care of, instead doctor will provide you a prescription in form of NFT and send it directly to your wallet address.
The next step is you need to go to a pharmacy (shop) to use your prescription as permission to buy that drug/medicine that was specified in the prescription.
After you have done, the pharmacy shop will keep your prescription NFT and return you a receipt NFT which keeps all information (Date time, drug name, etc.)  just like the prescription. 


***Benefits***.  
 - Keep track
 If something is fishy in the process and the police come to investigate it is much easier to keep track on the blockchain which already records transactions. 
 - Safer
As all data and information was kept on the blockchain it is easier to catch the criminal. For example, you may be seen some guy who got  20 prescription NFTs in only 1 week.
 - Manage
As a form of NFTs, you will no longer need to take care of it, like before you need to keep the receipt after buying a drug for at least 1-2 weeks but with Pharmaz it's all live and fresh on the blockchain. 


***Technologies***
 - Polygon 
 The fastest and most reliable blockchain that takes less gas fee.
 - IPFS
 The distributed system for storing and accessing files. Used for keeping prescription and receipt information and NFTs metadata.
 - Spheron & Filecoin 
With the combination of this two, I can easily deploy my decentralized application on the blockchain network.
